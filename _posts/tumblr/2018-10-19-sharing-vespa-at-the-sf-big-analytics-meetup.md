I had the wonderful opportunity to present [Vespa](https://vespa.ai/) at the [SF Big Analytics Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/SF-Big-Analytics/events/254461052/) on September 26th, hosted by [Amplitude](https://amplitude.com/). Several members of the Vespa team ([Kim](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kimomar/), [Frode](https://www.linkedin.com/in/frodelu/) and [Kristian](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kraune/)) also attended. We all enjoyed meeting with members of the Big Analytics community to discuss how Vespa could be helpful for their companies.

Thank you to [Chester Chen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chester-chen-3205992/), [T.J. Bay](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tjbay/), and [Jin Hao Wan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jin-hao-wan-0741a115/) for planning the meetup, and hereâ€™s our presentation, in case you missed it (slides are also available [here](https://www.slideshare.net/ydn/introduction-to-vespa-the-open-source-big-data-serving-engine)):&nbsp;
