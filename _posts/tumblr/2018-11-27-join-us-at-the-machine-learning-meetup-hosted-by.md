Hi Vespa Community,

If you are in Seattle on November 29th, please join Jon Bratseth (Distinguished Architect, Oath) at a machine learning meetup hosted by Zillow. Jon will share a Vespa overview and answer any questions about Oathâ€™s open source big data serving engine. Eric Ringger (Director of Machine Learning for Personalization, Zillow) will discuss some of the models used to help users find homes, including collaborative filtering, a content-based model, and deep learning.  
  
Learn more and RSVP [here](https://zillow.recsolu.com/external/events/VMuwf_D9TINXJel05xz3gQ).

Hope you can join!

The Vespa Team
